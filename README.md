When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Here is a series of steps on how to set up the project on your local machine.

Click [NewsApp](https://github.com/faithnjoki/Trending-News-) to navigate on the main page of the project repository on Github.

```
Clone the repository using HTTPS, click "Clone with HTTPS".
```

```
Open Terminal. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
```

```
Type https://github.com/faithnjoki/Trending-News-and press Enter to create your local clone.

```

```
Open NewsApp, the cloned Repo in terminal and run : pip install -r requirements.txt to install the app dependencies

```

```
Run source newsVirtual/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment and ./start.sh to launch the app

```
